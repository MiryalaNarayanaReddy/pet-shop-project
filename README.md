## about

-  this program keeps track of number of pets of each kind and their costs'
- it updates the number of pets automatically after someone buy(s) some pet(s).(or the owner wants to add some data to the database.txt).


`important: ` this program reads from file and then writes to the same file.(needs improvement).

Note: It will be interesting though this is ```not``` using any ```graphical interfaces```.
